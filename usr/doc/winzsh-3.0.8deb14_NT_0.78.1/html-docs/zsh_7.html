<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="zsh_toc.html#TOC37">Redirection</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>

</P>
<P>
Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected.
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
The following may appear anywhere in a simple command or may precede or
follow a complex command.  Substitution occurs before <VAR>word</VAR> or
<VAR>digit</VAR> is used except as noted below.  If the result of substitution on 
<VAR>word</VAR> produces more than one filename, redirection occurs for each 
separate filename in turn.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>&#60;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Open file <VAR>word</VAR> as standard input.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#62;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Open file <VAR>word</VAR> for reading and writing as standard input.  If the file 
does not exist then it is created.

<DT><CODE>&#62;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Open file <VAR>word</VAR> as standard output.  If the file does not exist
then it is created.  If the file exists, and the <CODE>CLOBBER</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
option is unset, this causes an error; otherwise, it is truncated to zero
length.

<DT><CODE>&#62;|<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>&#62;!<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>&#62;</CODE>, except that the file is truncated to zero length if it
exists, even if <CODE>CLOBBER</CODE> is unset.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#62;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Open file <VAR>word</VAR> as standard output.  If the file exists then output
is appended to it.  If the file does not exist, and the
<CODE>CLOBBER</CODE> option is unset, this causes an error; otherwise, the
file is created.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#62;|<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>&#62;&#62;!<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, except that the file is created if it does not exist,
even if <CODE>CLOBBER</CODE> is unset.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#60;[-]<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The shell input is read up to a line that is the same as <VAR>word</VAR>, or
to an end-of-file.  No parameter substitution, command substitution or
filename generation is performed on <VAR>word</VAR>.  The resulting document,
called a <STRONG>here-document</STRONG>, becomes the standard input.  If any
character of <VAR>word</VAR> is quoted with single or double quotes or a
<CODE>\</CODE>, no interpretation is placed upon the characters of the
document.  Otherwise, parameter and command substitution occurs,
<CODE>\</CODE> followed by a newline is removed, and <CODE>\</CODE> must be used to
quote the characters <CODE>\</CODE>, <CODE>$</CODE>, <CODE>`</CODE>, and the first
character of <VAR>word</VAR>.  If <CODE>&#60;&#60;-</CODE> is used, then all leading tabs
are stripped from <VAR>word</VAR> and from the document.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#60;&#60;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Perform shell expansion on <VAR>word</VAR> and pass the result to 
standard input.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#38;<VAR>digit</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The standard input is duplicated from file descriptor <VAR>digit</VAR> (see
<CODE>dup(2)</CODE>).  Similarly for standard output using
<CODE>&#62;&#38;<VAR>digit</VAR></CODE>.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#38;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>&#62;<VAR>word</VAR> 2&#62;&#38;1</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#62;&#38;<VAR>word</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>&#62;&#62;<VAR>word</VAR> 2&#62;&#38;1</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#38;-</CODE>
<DD>
Close the standard input.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#38;-</CODE>
<DD>
Close the standard output.

<DT><CODE>&#60;&#38;p</CODE>
<DD>
The input from the coprocess is moved to the standard input.

<DT><CODE>&#62;&#38;p</CODE>
<DD>
The output to the coprocess is moved to the standard output.
</DL>

<P>
If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file descriptor
referred to is that specified by the digit (instead of the default 0 or
1).  The order in which redirections are specified is significant.  The
shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the (<VAR>file descriptor</VAR>,
<VAR>file</VAR>) association at the time of evaluation.  For example:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>... 1&#62;<VAR>fname</VAR> 2&#62;&#38;1</CODE>

</P>
<P>
first associates file descriptor 1 with file <VAR>fname</VAR>.  It then
associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file
descriptor 1 (that is, <VAR>fname</VAR>).  If the order of redirections were
reversed, file descriptor 2 would be associated with the terminal
(assuming file descriptor 1 had been) and then file descriptor 1 would
be associated with file <VAR>fname</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
its input to all the specified outputs, similar to <CODE>tee(1)</CODE>, 
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
provided the <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> option is set.  Thus:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>date &#62;foo &#62;bar</CODE>

</P>
<P>
writes the date to two files, named <TT>`foo'</TT> and <TT>`bar'</TT>.  Note
that a pipe is an implicit indirection; thus

</P>
<P>
<CODE>date &#62;foo | cat</CODE>

</P>
<P>
writes the date to the file <TT>`foo'</TT>, and also pipes it to <CODE>cat</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> option is set, the word after a redirection 
operator is also subjected to filename generation (globbing).  Thus

</P>
<P>
<CODE>: &#62; *</CODE>

</P>
<P>
will truncate all files in the current directory, assuming there's at least 
one.  (Without the <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> option, it would create an empty file called
<TT>`*'</TT>.)

</P>
<P>
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
all the specified inputs to its output in the order specified, similar
to <CODE>cat(1)</CODE>, provided the <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> option is set.  Thus

</P>
<P>
<CODE>sort &#60;foo &#60;fubar</CODE>

</P>
<P>
or even

</P>
<P>
<CODE>sort &#60;f{oo,ubar}</CODE>

</P>
<P>
is equivalent to <SAMP>`cat foo fubar | sort'</SAMP>.  Similarly, you can do

</P>
<P>
<CODE>echo exit 0 &#62;&#62; *.sh</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Note that a pipe is an implicit indirection; thus

</P>
<P>
<CODE>cat bar | sort &#60;foo</CODE>

</P>
<P>
is equivalent to <SAMP>`cat bar foo | sort'</SAMP> (note the order of the inputs).

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> option is unset, each redirection replaces the previous
redirection for that file descriptor.  However, all files redirected to are 
actually opened, so

</P>
<P>
<CODE>echo foo &#62; bar &#62; baz</CODE>

</P>
<P>
when <CODE>MULTIOS</CODE> is unset will truncate <CODE>bar</CODE>, and write <CODE>foo</CODE>
into <CODE>baz</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators and
zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name, the command
<CODE>cat</CODE> is assumed.  Thus

</P>
<P>
<CODE>&#60; file</CODE>

</P>
<P>
copies the contents of <CODE>file</CODE> to the standard output.

</P>
<P>
If a command is followed by <CODE>&#38;</CODE> and job control is not active, then
the default standard input for the command is the empty file
<TT>`/dev/null'</TT>.  Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a
command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified
by input/output specifications.
