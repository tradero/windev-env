<P>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>MONITOR</CODE> option is set, an interactive shell associates a
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<STRONG>job</STRONG> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of current jobs,
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
printed by the <CODE>jobs</CODE> command, and assigns them small integer
numbers.  When a job is started asynchronously with <CODE>&#38;</CODE>, the shell
prints a line which looks like:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>[1] 1234</CODE>

</P>
<P>
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.

</P>
<P>
If a job is started with <CODE>&#38;|</CODE> or <CODE>&#38;!</CODE>, then that job is
immediately disowned.  After startup, it does not have a place in the job
table, and is not subject to the job control features described here.

</P>
<P>
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the
key <KBD>^Z</KBD> (control-Z) which sends a <CODE>TSTP</CODE> signal to the current
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
job.  The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been
<STRONG>suspended</STRONG>, and print another prompt.  You can then manipulate the
state of this job, putting it into the background with the <CODE>bg</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
command, or run some other commands and then eventually bring the job
back into the foreground with the foreground command <CODE>fg</CODE>.  A
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<KBD>^Z</KBD> takes effect immediately and is like an interrupt in that
pending output and unread input are discarded when it is typed.

</P>
<P>
A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read from
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
the terminal.  Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command <CODE>stty tostop</CODE>.  If
you set this tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try
to produce output, like they do when they try to read input.

</P>
<P>
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.  A job can be
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
referred to by the process id of any process of the job or by one of the
following:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>%<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
The job with the given number.

<DT><CODE>%<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Any job whose command line begins with <VAR>string</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>%?<VAR>string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Any job whose command line contains <VAR>string</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>%%</CODE>
<DD>
Current job.

<DT><CODE>%+</CODE>
<DD>
Equivalent to <CODE>%%</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>%-</CODE>
<DD>
Previous job.
</DL>

<P>
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.  It
normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further
progress is possible.  If <CODE>notify</CODE> is not set, it waits until just
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
before it prints a prompt before it informs you.

</P>
<P>
When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes triggers
any trap set for <CODE>CHLD</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you
will be warned that <SAMP>`You have suspended (running) jobs'</SAMP>.  You may
use the <CODE>jobs</CODE> command to see what they are.  If you do this or
immediately try to exit again, the shell will not warn you a second
time; the suspended jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will
be sent a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal.  To avoid having the shell terminate the
running jobs, either use the <CODE>nohup(1)</CODE> command or the
<CODE>disown</CODE> builtin (see section <A HREF="zsh_17.html#SEC64">Shell Builtin Commands</A>).
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>INT</CODE> and <CODE>QUIT</CODE> signals for an invoked command are
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
ignored if the command is followed by <CODE>&#38;</CODE> and the job <CODE>monitor</CODE>
option is not active.  Otherwise, signals have the values inherited by
the shell from its parent (but See section <A HREF="zsh_9.html#SEC39">Functions</A>, for the
<CODE>TRAP<VAR>xxx</VAR></CODE> special functions).
