<P>
If a command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.
If there exists a shell function by that name, the function is invoked
as described below (see section <A HREF="zsh_9.html#SEC39">Functions</A>).  If there exists a shell builtin
by that name, the builtin is invoked.

</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the shell searches each element of <CODE>path</CODE> for a directory
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
containing an executable file by that name.  If the search is
unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns a nonzero
exit status.

</P>
<P>
If execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the
file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script.
<CODE>/bin/sh</CODE> is spawned to execute it.  If the program is a file
beginning with <CODE>#!</CODE>, the remainder of the first line specifies an
interpreter for the program.  The shell will execute the specified
interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable
format in the kernel.
